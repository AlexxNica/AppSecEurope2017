## Main Conference Tracks

The main conference talks take place over two full day and four conference tracks, specially designed for the contemporary application security industry. Along with four keynote speeches from industry thought leaders, these two days offer plenty of choice for delegates to make the learning experience their own.

The four tracks for AppSecEU 2017 are:

* Hackers; this track is for the pentesters and ethical hackers who want to learn the latest hacks.
* Developers; this one is for the builders and security engineers creating secure applications and defending those applications.
* DevSecOps; this is our very own devsecops track, leveraging this growing discipline to discover the latest thinking on securing the entire SDLC.
* CISO; for the delegates covering security governance risk and control, managing security into organizations.

Each day starts and ends with a keynote presentation, with great track talks covering the rest of the day. Delegates are free to move between tracks and the other events listed below.


## Capture The Flag

Do you hack websites? Do you like to solve puzzles? Would you like to compare your skills against other hackers? AppSecEU will be hosting their Capture the Flag event to be held on the Thursday and Friday of the conference. As always this event will be accessible for all attendees. The CTF prides itself to have a huge variety of challenges across multiple disciplines ranges from web- to network- and even cryptography challenges. All you need to bring is your laptop with all your favourite tools, a sharp mind and the patience to solve the challenges. Next to the pride and joy of playing there will be prices for the top three players.


## Sponsor Exhibits

In the center of the conference is the sponsor exhibits, where application security vendors can show off their products and talk with delegates. Look out for the many free giveaways and competitions where you can bag lots of swag. Snacks, coffee and lunch is also served in the sponsor hall.


## Activities and Arsenal

Activity events can be run on the Thursday and Friday alongside the main conference in the conference venue. Activities are suggested for the conference and may be an Escape room event, or lock picking demonstrations.
AppSecEU is also excited to be hosting an Arsenal room where open source tools and projects can show-off their work to the hundreds of delegates attending the conference. The AppSecEU Arsenal will take place on Thursday and Friday. Open source projects taking part in the Arsenal will display/demo for one or two days.


## Lightning Talks and Training

AppSecEU is hosting a room for Lightning Talks & Training on the Thursday and Friday, during the main conference days. A lightning talk is a short presentation (less than 15 minutes) on a topic of interest to application security. A lightning training is a short training session (less than 2 hours).
They are fairly informal and take place in a dedicated room close to the track rooms. They are posted to the conference schedule (online and in brochure).


## Conference Dinner

AppSecEU delegates will be enjoying a prestigious conference dinner in the Titanic Center, a beautiful museum and tourist attraction that has just been named the world's leading tourist attraction for 2016.

The night will start with a drinks reception in the Giant Atrium followed by buffet dinner in the Titanic Suite, inspired by RMS Titanic's opulent interiors and overlooking the Game of Thrones studios. All conference delegates receive a ticket for the conference dinner, while extra tickets can be purchased during registration.
