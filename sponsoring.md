## Why you should sponsor the AppSec Europe?

OWASP’s Global AppSec Conferences are its flagship outreach effort.  Each year OWASP hosts two global AppSec conferences:

* OWASP AppSec USA
* OWASP ApPSec Europe

OWASP events attract a worldwide audience interested in “what’s next?” — as an OWASP Conference sponsor, your brand will be included as an answer.

OWASP offers a variety of opportunities for advertising and logo placement at their AppSec conferences

OWASP has a strong open and global community with more than 45.000 participants, more than 65 organisational supporters and over 60 academic supportes via 200 local chapters across 6 continents in 117 countries.

The conference is expected to draw over 800 international attendees, all with budgets dedicated to web application security initiatives. Financial Services, Media, Pharmaceuticals, Government, Healthcare, Technology, and many other verticals will be represented. Sponsorship opportunities are filling up rapidly.

Any proceeds from sponsorship support the mission of the OWASP Foundation (501c3 Not-For-Profit), driving funding for conferences, research grants, tools and documents, local chapters, and more.

OWASP Appsec Europe 2016 provides sponsors with exclusive access to its audience through a limited number of exhibit spaces.
