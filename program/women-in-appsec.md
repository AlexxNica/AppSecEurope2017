# Women in AppSec @ AppSec EU 2017

Women in AppSec is kicking it up a notch at AppSec EU 2017 and we want YOU to join us! We’re putting together some great events for the conference, including a networking session, a mentoring breakfast, and a panel. Make sure you stop by during the week to check out our events and to learn more about the group. 

WIA launched in 2011, and this year it became an official committee of OWASP. The purpose of the Women in AppSec (WIA) committee is to develop leadership, promote active membership and participation, and contributions by women in application security professional communities, globally and locally.
