***May 9th - 10th, 2017***

We have an open session for two days for Project Reviews during our OWASP Project Summit EU 2017 Belfast.  We are looking for some volunteers to review projects and helping make OWASP Projects move to the next level with your expertise and feedback.

Please [Sign Up](https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheets/d/1c2wal0e-VsJadHrLnrPLl0m3uRVKbTDnUpjlZbDdvro/edit?usp=sharing) and join us in APPSEC EU 2016 in Belfast!

We currently have these leaders attending and want to send thank you for stepping up to the challenge and thank Johanna Curiel, our current Vice Chair on the Board, for helping us lead this effort.

### Overview of Project Reviews:

OWASP is reviewing projects who wish to graduate from [Incubator](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Project_Inventory#tab=Incubator_Projects) to [Lab](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Project_Inventory#tab=Labs_Projects) to [Flagship](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Project_Inventory#tab=Flagship_Projects).  The purpose of this assessment is to determine whether a project meets the minimum criteria to graduate as outlined in the [Project Health Assessment Criteria Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1upIyG0L-P-myUM6EPg0aJmCTDvJrdqaVdnjdNBME9is/edit#gid=1).  The review process begins with an initial self-assessment done by the project leader and reviewed by Matt Tesauro.  Next, the assessment enters the peer review phase where we ask volunteers in our OWASP Community to participate and finalize the results. I have included a [Sample of a Project Assessment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NQSHshTxK1AWTkD4WgYluxSafgO-XGDHZnwE9Qvt7TE/edit?usp=sharing) for your review and consideration.
