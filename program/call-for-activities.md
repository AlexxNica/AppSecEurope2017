# {{page.title}}

This year we are hoping to run a variety of different activities at the conference and are welcoming bids and suggestions for events that can be run on the 11th and / or the 12th of May alongside the main conference in the Waterfront.

All types of activity will be considered with preference given to those with a more security focussed theme, so whether it's a Capture the Flag event, an Escape room event, lock picking demonstrations or something else then please review and fill in the form to register your interest in attending.

OWASP is a non-profit organisation and will not be able to invest significantly in the cost of activities, however if funding is required we can offer the event as a sponsorship opportunity to our vendors. This will then cover the cost of any expenditures related to running the event.

To register your activity please review and complete the form at:
