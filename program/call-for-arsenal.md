Anyone wishing to display their open source hacking tool, guides, research or more can use the Arsenal to attract more users and even gain more contributors.
The AppSec EU Arsenal will take place during the conference days (Thursday 11th and Friday 12th May 2017).  Open source projects taking part in the Arsenal can display/demo for one or two days, depending on their requirements.  All projects talking part in the Arsenal will be advertised in the conference brochure as well as on the conference web site.

Successful entrants will be given a complimentary ticket the conference (including dinner).  Only one person will be able to avail of this offer per arsenal entry. Spaces in the Arsenal room will be limited, and only projects selected by the committee will be able to demo.
