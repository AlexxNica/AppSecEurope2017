As part of AppSec EU 2017, we are holding our Call For Lightning Talks & Training in which you can register your interest to participate with us in Belfast on the 11th and 12th of May 2017.

A lightning talk is a short presentation (less than 30 minutes) on a topic of interest to conference attendees.  A lightning training is a short training session (less than 2 hours), again of interest to conference attendees.  They are fairly informal and take place in a dedicated room close to the track rooms.   They are posted to the conference schedule (online and in brochure) to allow conference attendees to attend.

Lightning talks and training can be about any application security topic.  It could a technical subject,  examples of applying security to a company, or discussions on the overall industry.  Examples of lightning talks and training at previous conference includes:

* CSP
* XML schema vulnerabilities
* How not to security test your web app
* Bug bounties
* Getting started with ModSecurity
* Web app security testing with Fiddler

Successful entrants will be given a complimentary ticket the conference (including dinner).  Only one person will be able to avail of this offer per lightning talk or training.
