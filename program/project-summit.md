***May 9th - 10th, 2017***

We are excited to announce the OWASP Project Summit EU 2017.  OWASP is providing a platform for project leaders on the two full days prior to AppSec EU 2017.  The platform provides an open forum setting for ideas, discussing innovations, gaining project contributors and sharing feedback for projects with the goal of helping them  advance to the next level.

This year’s project summit will include the opportunity to work on some of the hot
topics and initiatives being discussed at OWASP. Please give us your feedback on 
which of the following topics you’d like to see discussed at the summit.  We’ve listed
some below - feel free to suggest others:

* Gamification and badges
* OWASP Documentation Projects into github/markdown & sharing content
* Project Review Activities and the new Conversational Review methods

Use this opportunity to demo your project to others at the summit, promote for sponsorship, gain feedback, or simply brainstorm some ideas and add a few features. 

Let's make this a success: [Sign up!](https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheets/d/1c2wal0e-VsJadHrLnrPLl0m3uRVKbTDnUpjlZbDdvro/edit?usp=sharing)
