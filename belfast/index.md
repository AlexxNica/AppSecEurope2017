Belfast can trace it's roots back to the early Bronze Age, as demonstrated by the Neolithic henge at nearby, Giant's Ring.  (I have a few of my own photos that I can send through of Giants ring, if we want to fill space).  However, it was not until the 18th Century that it came to prominence as an industrial centre and merchant city.  It's location at the head of the Belfast Lough helped the shipyards flourish, at one point employing over 35,000 men.  And it was a Belfast shipyard, Harland & Wolff, that built the world-renowned SS Titanic, which is commemorated by the stunning Titanic Centre, where we have dinner on the Thursday night of the Conference.  

The marshy land on which the city was built, allowed for it to become the centre of linen production worldwide, in addition to being a centre for tobacco factories and other industries.  

However, industries change and Belfast is once again flourishing as a technology hub, and home to globally recognised technology companies such as BlackDuck Software, WhiteHat Security, Allstate and many other tech giants attracted by the availability of world-class talent and easy access to the UK, Irish and European markets.

The city also benefits from convenient transport links both locally and internationally and access to some of the most stunning countryside you could wish to see.  From the Giant's Causeway, the beautiful Mourne Mountains and of course, the picturesque Antrim Glens - the location of Game of Thrones!

We look forward to showing you all that Belfast has to offer!
